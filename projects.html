            <p>**Note: University of California, San Diego Projects**<br>
                <br>
                As a sign of respect for the academic integrity of the University of California, San Diego, I have decided not to publicly share the source code or GitHub repositories for certain projects completed during my studies. These projects were assigned and developed as part of my coursework and represent the hard work and dedication put forth in my education.
                
                While I am unable to showcase the code itself, I'm happy to provide detailed information and descriptions about these projects, their objectives, and the skills I've gained through working on them. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about these projects, feel free to contact me directly.
                
                Thank you for understanding and respecting my commitment to maintaining the academic integrity of my educational institution. <br>
                <br>
                Sincerely,
                David Montoto
