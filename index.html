            <p>Where passion meets expertise and innovation intertwines with determination. 
                As a sophomore at UCSD, specializing in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Finance, I am a relentless force driven by the pursuit of excellence. 
                With a diverse skill set encompassing Java, JavaScript, C++, C, Python, R, MATLAB, HTML, CSS, and Node.js, 
                I have embarked on an extraordinary journey in software and web development, leaving a lasting impact. Over the past year, as a software engineer at Beverly Hills Aerials, 
                I have proven my dedication, collaborating with like-minded individuals to create groundbreaking solutions. 
                I embody the qualities of a hardworking individual who thrives on collaboration and is always seeking new and exciting projects. 
                Join me on this exhilarating adventure where innovation knows no bounds.</p>
